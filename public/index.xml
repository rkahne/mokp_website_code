      <description>My Old Kentucky Podcast Robert Kahne and Jazmin Smith began hosting My Old Kentucky Podcast in the fall of 2016, and have since released 100 episodes. The show details politics and government in the commonwealth of Kentucky. In summer of 2017, MOKP grew to include a weekly newsletter. Robert and Jazmin are both progressive people, but they strives to give an even handed treatment to all issues. MOKP typically includes a guest appearance, and several of the most important figures in Kentucky have appeared on the show or written for the newsletter.</description>
