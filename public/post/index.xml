      <description>Last year, I used W-Nominate scores to do an ideological rank ordering of the Kentucky . It was an interesting project. But, several folks reached out to me, worried that the scores lacked some context. After spending some time reflecting on that, I decided that those people were correct &amp;ndash; and this year, when I completed the same project, I added some extra information.
