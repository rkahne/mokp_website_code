Last year, I used W-Nominate scores to do an [ideological rank ordering of the Kentucky ](https://rkahne.github.io/blog/2017/04/19/w-nominate-scores/).  It was an interesting project. But, several folks reached out to me, worried that the scores lacked some context.  After spending some time reflecting on that, I decided that those people were correct -- and this year, when I [completed the same project](https://rkahne.github.io/one_page/kyleg-18-pt-1.html), I added some extra information.

I think if you asked 20 people who follow Kentucky politics closely "Who is the Kentucky legislator who is furthest to the left?", 19 or more would say "Representative Attica Scott".  This year she voted against several bills that had very broad support, such as HB 1 (the adoption reform legislation), HB 362 (which allows students to miss school in order to meet with military recruiters), and even HR 37 (a resolution recognizing Jan. 16 as "National Religious Freedom Day").  However, when looking at W-Nominate scores alone, she only has the third-lowest score, behind Rep. Kelly Flood and Rep. Jeff Donohue.

W-Nominate only takes into account bills with at least 20% opposition.  This is by design -- it makes statistical modeling easier.  However, it does drop a significant amount of context.  In my analysis, I highlighted that Rep. Scott voted against bills with fewer than 5 people joining her in opposition 14 times, which is more than any other House member.  Additionally, she voted with Rep. Rocky Adkins, the leader of the Democratic Party in the House, only 80% of the time.  That's the lowest percentage among House Democrats, and 80% is a smaller percentage than all House Republicans voted with Rep. David Osborne, the Republican leader.  With this context, I think it's fair to say that the conventional wisdom is correct -- Rep. Scott is likely the the House Democrat furthest to the left.

I think it's important to point out that while Rep. Scott only voted with Rep. Adkins 80% of the time, when isolating only the bills where Rep. Adkins voted differently than Rep. Osborne (i.e., Democratic leadership opposed Republican leadership), Rep. Scott voted with Rep. Adkins 96% of the time -- which is above average.

There are other interesting things I uncovered in my analysis -- for example, there are two Republican Senators who are further to the left than the furthest right Democratic Senator (who happens to be in leadership!).  I encourage you to click the link above and check it out.
